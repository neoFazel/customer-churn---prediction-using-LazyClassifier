README for Churn Customer Prediction using LazyClassifier

This repository contains code for predicting customer churn using machine learning. The code uses the LazyClassifier library to quickly test and compare multiple machine learning models.

To use this code, you will need to provide your own dataset. You can either create your own dataset or use an existing one. i recommend using the Churn Modelling dataset available on Kaggle.

To use the Churn Modelling dataset, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset
2. Extract the dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
3. Rename the dataset file to `churn.csv`.

Once you have added your dataset, you can run the `churn_prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to train and test multiple machine learning models using LazyClassifier.

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
